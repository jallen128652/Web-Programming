          Schooling is tough but also fulfilling. If obtaining a dream was easy
          then it definitely wasn't earned. My life can be shaped but only with
          the correct tools. I must make the commitment to succeed and proceed
          with my goals and overcome any obstacles that I will be found in my
          path during my journey
