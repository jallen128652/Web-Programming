Things to modify using JavaScript and the DOM:

DONE. The body paragraph for the webpage should be modified with an inspirational paragraph of at least four 
sentences long.

Download three images using unsplash.com or utilize three of your own original photos. Crop and optimize
 the downloaded (or original) images so that they match dimensions of the original webpage’s images.  
 Note:  If you crop each image to 2000 x 1500 and then change the image size to 615 x 461 72ppi, they 
 should match perfectly.

Using JavaScript code only, replace each of the three original images found on the webpage with the three
 downloaded images. 

Change the heading for each image using the querySelectorAll() method. (Hint: array)

Change the paragraph for each image so that it fits/compliments the new image.

You will see three buttons on the webpage at the bottom. Add functionality to the script so that when 
each button is clicked, the header’s background color changes to a different color. Choose appropriate 
colors.  If the new font color and new background color do not contrast well, you may need to change the
 header’s font color as well. (Hint: Event listeners and Functions)

Remember: Each of these changes should be accomplished with JavaScript alone.  The only HTML code you can
 directly modify in the manipulatingDOM.html page (if necessary) is the path for the image files, CSS file,
  and script file.  Do not change the HTML code or the CSS file code.

Make sure you utilize the videos and the console window. If you can grab what you want from the HTML page
 using JavaScript in the console window, then it should be straightforward  as to what needs to be added
  to your JavaScript file.  In other words, the process of trial and error is much quicker in the
   browser’s console than in the JavaScript file.
