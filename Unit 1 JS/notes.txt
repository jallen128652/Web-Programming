1. Javascript is case sensitive for everything but inside quoted strings.
2. Javascript uses camelCase.
-Variables start with lowercase letter: var greenDuck;
-Objects and classes start with uppercase letter: var date = Date();
-Constants are all caps: const = CONSTANTLYUPPERCASE;
3. Whitespace matters to readability.
-readable:
  var date = new Date();
  document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>" + date + "</h1>";
-not readable:
  var date=new Date();document.body.innerHTML="<h1>"+date+"</h1>";
4. End each statement with a semicolon.
5. Use comments liberally:
- // single line comments
- /* multi line comments */
6. Comments can be used to document code or to disable code.
- disabling code using comments can assist with debugging
- can disable multiple lines of code using multi line comments
- use caution with multi line comments as */ is also part of some lines of valid code
7. Comments help you remember the functionality of what you wrote and others who contribute.
