          <dd>
            1883 is an American Western drama television limited-run series

            Paramount+. The series stars Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Sam Elliott,
            Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett, Marc Rissmann, Audie Rick, Eric
            Nelsen, and James Landry Hébert. The series is a prequel to
            Sheridan's series Yellowstone and follows the story of how the
            Duttons came to own the land that would become the Yellowstone
            Ranch. The series consisted of ten episodes and concluded on
            February 27, 2022. The series follows the post-Civil war generation
            of the Dutton family as they leave Tennessee, journey to Fort Worth,
            Texas, and join a wagon train undertaking the arduous journey west
            to Oregon, before settling in Montana to establish what would
            eventually become the Yellowstone Ranch.

          <dt>Vikings</dt>
          <dd>
            Vikings is a historical drama television series created and written
            by Michael Hirst for the History channel, a Canadian network. Filmed
            in Ireland, it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. The series
            concluded on December 30, 2020, when the second half of the sixth
            season was released. The series is inspired by the tales of the
            Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia. It broadly follows the
            exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his
            crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the
            13th-century sagas Ragnars saga Loðbrókar and Ragnarssona þáttr, as
            well as in Saxo Grammaticus' 12th-century work Gesta Danorum.

          <dt>Lost in Space</dt>
          <dd>
            Lost in Space is an American science fiction streaming television
            series following the adventures of a family of space colonists whose
            ship veers off course. The series is a reboot of the 1965 series of
            the same name, inspired by the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson
            and the 1962 Gold Key comic book, Space Family Robinson created by
            Del Connell and artist Dan Spiegle. In 2046, two years after an
            impact event that threatens the survival of humanity, the Robinson
            family is selected for the 24th mission of the Resolute (24th
            Colonist Group), an interstellar spacecraft carrying selected
            families and civilians to colonize the Alpha Centauri planetary
            system. Before they reach their destination, an alien robot breaches
            the Resolute's hull. Forced to evacuate the mothership in numerous
            short-range Jupiter spacecraft, scores of colonists, among them the
            Robinsons, crash on a nearby habitable planet. There they must
            contend with a strange environment and battle their own personal
            demons as they search for a way back to the Resolute.

          <dt>The 100</dt>
          <dd>
            The 100 (pronounced The Hundred) is an American post-apocalyptic
            science fiction drama television series that premiered on March 19,
            2014 on The CW, and ended on September 30, 2020. Developed by Jason
            Rothenberg, the series is loosely based on the young adult novel
            series of the same name by Kass Morgan.[3] The 100 follows
            post-apocalyptic survivors from a space habitat, the Ark, who return
            to Earth nearly a century after a devastating nuclear apocalypse.
            The first people sent to Earth are a group of juvenile delinquents
            who encounter descendants of survivors of the nuclear disaster on
            the ground. Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear
            apocalypse wipes out most human life on Earth, thousands of people
            now live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark.
            Three generations have been born in space, but when life-support
            systems on the Ark begin to fail, one hundred juvenile detainees are
            sent to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is
            habitable, or at least save resources for the remaining residents of
            the Ark. They discover that some survived the apocalypse: the
            Grounders, who live in clans are locked in a power struggle.

          <dt>The Magicians</dt>
          <dd>
            The Magicians is an American fantasy television series that aired on
            Syfy and is based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Lev
            Grossman.[2] Michael London, Janice Williams, John McNamara, and
            Sera Gamble serve as executive producers. A 13-episode order was
            placed for the first season in May 2015, and the series premiered on
            December 16, 2015, as a special preview. In January 2019, Syfy
            renewed the series for a fifth and final season, which ran from
            January 15 to April 1, 2020. In the show, students at a secretive
            school of magic find that the magical world is more dangerous than
            they realized. Quentin Coldwater enrolls at Brakebills University
            for Magical Pedagogy to be trained as a magician, where he discovers
            that the magical world from his favorite childhood book is real and
            poses a danger to humanity. Meanwhile, the life of his childhood
            friend Julia is derailed when she is denied entry, and she searches
            for magic elsewhere outside of the school.
