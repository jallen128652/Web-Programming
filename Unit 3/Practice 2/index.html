    <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      I have been playing off and on for a couple of years. My friend was
      invited several years ago, and he didn't want to go by himself. After that
      day I was hooked, the technique that is required is very similar to play
      golf. Recently, I have been focused on improving my technique. This sport
      is a great stress reliever and it is great for exercise.
