      <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
      <p>
        Jim's hobbies include Snowboarding, metal fabrication and welding, 3d
        printing and cryptocurrencies. Jim has been doing metal fabrication for
        the purpose of developing automotive performance parts since high
        school. While Jim was stationed in Germany he learned to snowboard and
        has been an avid snowboarder since about 2003. During a training
        exercise in 2016, Jim shattered his left hand in six places. This
        required him to find a new hobby while it was healing. Jim picked up 3d
        printing. Jim enjoyed the process of 3d printing and even starting
        building his own 3d printers to include modifying the Marlin firmware
        and setting up a wifi print servor.
