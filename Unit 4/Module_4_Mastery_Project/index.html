      <h2>Jim's early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Jim was born on February 16th 1978 in Mount Holly Township NJ. When Jim
        was just 6 months old, his parents left military survice and moved to
        Southern California. Jim attended Quartz Hill High School and then
        promptly ran into troubles after high school. After that Jim moved to
        Las Vegas for a fresh start. While in Las Vegas Jim worked as a carwash
        manager for Terrible Herbst Oil Company and later as an Iron Worker.
        While Jim lived in Las Vegas, he had a pitbull puppy names Shovelhead.
        Just the best boy ever. Well long story short his apartment complex
        didn't like Shovelhead. While he was in between places to live, he
        boarded shovelhead with a friend till he could get another apartment.
        This "friend" left Shovelhead in the backyard and left town without
        telling Jim. By the time Jim found out, poor Shovelhead had been taken
        to a kill shelter by Animal Control and euthanized ;( This was a
        significant emotional event for Jim which lead him to leaving Las Vegas
        and joining the Army in July of 2001.<br />
