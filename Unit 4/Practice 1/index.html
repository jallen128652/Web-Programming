      <p class="back">
        I decided to go to school because I just retired from the Army. I chose
        TSTC because it appeared to be more promising for actually learning
        software development. I have yet to decide if this is the case as I have
        had no positive interaction with my instructors and am considering going
        the bootcamp route after this semester. I am very much wondering why I'm
        paying for this school as most of the resources they use are cheap or
        free and there is no instruction by the instructors. Honestly I'm here
        to learn not to pass tests and get a piece of paper.

      <h2 class="header_color">My Dreams</h2>
      <p class="highlight">
        My dream is to develop my own software and even firmware for
        programmable logic controllers. Programmable logic controllers are used
        in robotics and 3d printing and also to control your car. I want to be
        able to develop custom applications using programmable logic
        controllers, while also building the front end software to calibrate the
        controller and the firmware inside the controller. The applications for
        this are endless.

      <p class="background">
        I promise never to cave to the grind mentality and always chase my
        dreams and not a useless job. I'm retired, I have the luxury after
        working for 27 years already to chase my dreams and not settle for a
        crappy job working for someone else ever again. I will also not
        compromise on my learning quality for a grade that will in effect do
        nothing for me.
