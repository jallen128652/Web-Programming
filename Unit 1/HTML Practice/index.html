            As per our email instructions:
            One of your quiz questions may ask you to email me about when to ask for help, when you are struggling. 
            Please don't!

            Instead, read the course communications page.
            In short, you can contact me anytime, but I typically answer M-F 8-5. 
            You can use email or direct chat. Do not use the canvas messing/mailing system.
