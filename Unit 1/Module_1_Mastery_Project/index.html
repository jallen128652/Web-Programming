    <h1>Jim's Biography Page</h1>
    <h2>Jim's early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Jim was born on February 16th 1978 in Mount Holly Township NJ. When Jim
      was just 6 months old, his parents left military survice and moved to
      Southern California. Jim attended Quartz Hill High School and then
      promptly ran into troubles after high school. After that Jim moved to Las
      Vegas for a fresh start. While in Las Vegas Jim worked as a carwash
      manager for Terrible Herbst Oil Company and later as an Iron Worker. While
      Jim lived in Las Vegas, he had a pitbull puppy names Shovelhead. Just the
      best boy ever. Well long story short his apartment complex didn't like
      Shovelhead. While he was in between places to live, he boarded shovelhead
      with a friend till he could get another apartment. This "friend" left
      Shovelhead in the backyard and left town without telling Jim. By the time
      Jim found out, poor Shovelhead had been taken to a kill shelter by Animal
      Control and euthanized ;( This was a significant emotional event for Jim
      which lead him to leaving Las Vegas and joining the Army in July of 2001
