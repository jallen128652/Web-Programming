You will be designing for a T-Shirt company that sells shirts as well as designs and prints their own products. Design a
 product page so that a user can fill in an order and see the total cost for the request.
  (This will be one page that a T-Shirt company can add to their existing website.)

Using Adobe XD, mock-up the layout, color choices, and any designs you plan on using for your webpage.
 (This will save you time when you start programming) Remember Adobe XD is just a mock-up, the real design will be when
  you code your webpage.

Make sure you add the basic design for a webpage that includes: Appropriate HTML semantic elementsLinks to an external site.,
 logo(s), navigation, CSS styling (including the form, inputs, fonts, etc).  The navigation links don't need to link to
  anything as they are just placeholders. Use your imagination, but make the site look professional.

The webpage should include a minimum of 6 input typesLinks to an external site.. You can use more of the same type but
 your site should contain a minimum of six different types not including the submit or reset inputs.
Include:

2 text inputs (One can be for a company name and something else; Or, first name and last name.)
3 checkboxes (Each value attribute should be a price)
2 radio buttons (Each value attribute should be a price)
1 email
2 additional and different input types of your choice

The form should also contain a submit button. This should be used to place an order and the user should be presented with
 the order information and total pricing.

Add a reset button that resets the form.

A minimum of 2 optimized images.  Make sure they are appropriate for the site and include width, height, and accessibility
 attributes.

**********JavaScript Requirements:***********************
You must comment on your JavaScript code and label your requirements with comments to get full credit for each requirement
 you choose.

Your code should include any validation necessary, make sure your present helpful guidance to the user when they use
 incorrect input or special requirements. (Option: alert method)

A minimum of two functions.  One function must return a value, and the returned value must be captured and utilized in
 some manner.  The other function must accept at least one argument.  The argument passed to the function must be utilized
  within the function.

You must use at least eight (8) of the items listed below in your code.  Make sure you label each item with a comment to
 get full credit.  If you create your code with all 12 items but you don't label them, you will not get credit.
   A simple comment will suffice for these items: //Loop or //Array, //Event Listener, etc.   Multiple uses of the same
    item count as one.

Variables
Arithmetic Operators
Loops
If and Else
Switch
Arrays
Try/Catch(Finally/Throw)
Event listener
Let
Constant
Boolean
String Methods

Make sure you debug your code and that it works as it should for the user. Utilize the browser developer tools and console
 for bebugging/troubleshooting.

Once again, don't forget to label your code with comments that highlight your 9 item choices. You can use more than 9 but
 you will only get credit for 9 of them.

This assignment must be your work and your work only.  If you are caught cheating, you will get a grade of zero.

Make sure you allow yourself enough time to complete the final and submit it before the deadline. If you have any questions,
 please reach out to your instructor as soon as possible.

If I can make your code crash or if it doesn't work as intended, you will receive -30 points. Make sure you debug your code
 and test, test, and test again before submitting it.
